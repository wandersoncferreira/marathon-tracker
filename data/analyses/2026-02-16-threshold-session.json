  "analysis": {
    "strengths": [
      "Progressive overload - each interval slightly harder than the last",
      "Power:HR decoupling of 2.9% - excellent aerobic efficiency",
      "Consistent cadence 87-90 rpm throughout intervals",
      "Variability Index: 1.01 - very steady effort",
      "W' Balance remained high - only used 79 kJ of anaerobic reserve"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Recovery intervals incomplete - HR only dropped to 159 avg during recoveries",
      "Interval length too short (3min) for marathon specificity",
      "Peak effort at 93% FTP pushes into VO2max territory",
      "Progressive cardiac drift - HR climbed from 155 to 167 across intervals"
    ],
    "keyFindings": [
      "Threshold pace (4:06/km) is faster than marathon goal (4:02/km) - excellent positioning",
      "HR progression 155→167 bpm tracks with lactate threshold work",
      "Cardiovascular cost: need 158-164 bpm for marathon pace",
      "Training Load: 59 (solid stress without breaking down)"

      "Tuesday: Easy 12-14km @ 4:50-5:00/km OR double with 6km @ 4:05/km in PM",

      "Thursday: Easy 10km @ 5:00/km",
      "Friday: Recovery 8km @ 5:10/km",
      "Saturday: Long run 26-28km - start 4:35/km, finish last 5km @ 4:05/km"

    "progressionNotes": "Extend threshold intervals. You've proven you can execute 800m reps - time to progress to longer efforts that build sustained lactate clearance."
